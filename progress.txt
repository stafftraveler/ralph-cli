# Progress Log

## Iteration 1

**Task**: Remove unused openInEditor() function (PRD cleanup task)

**What was done**:
- Deleted entire src/lib/editor.ts file (38 lines of dead code)
- openInEditor() function was exported but never imported anywhere
- Function provided editor-opening functionality that was never integrated

**Files changed**:
- src/lib/editor.ts (deleted entirely)

**Reasoning**: Complete dead code file. Function exported but never used. Removing eliminates unnecessary execa dependency usage and 38 lines of maintenance burden.

**Impact**: Reduced codebase by 38 lines. Eliminated unused editor integration module. Cleaner lib/ directory.

**All checks passed**: format, lint, types ✓
