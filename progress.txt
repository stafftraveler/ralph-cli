# Progress Log

## Iteration 1

**Task**: Remove unused openInEditor() function (PRD cleanup task)

**What was done**:
- Deleted entire src/lib/editor.ts file (38 lines of dead code)
- openInEditor() function was exported but never imported anywhere
- Function provided editor-opening functionality that was never integrated

**Files changed**:
- src/lib/editor.ts (deleted entirely)

**Reasoning**: Complete dead code file. Function exported but never used. Removing eliminates unnecessary execa dependency usage and 38 lines of maintenance burden.

**Impact**: Reduced codebase by 38 lines. Eliminated unused editor integration module. Cleaner lib/ directory.

**All checks passed**: format, lint, types ✓

## Iteration 2

**Task**: Remove unused runBeforeIteration() function (PRD cleanup task)

**What was done**:
- Removed runBeforeIteration() function from src/lib/plugins.ts (9 lines)
- Function was exported but never imported anywhere
- Other plugin hook wrappers (runBeforeRun, runAfterIteration, runDone, runOnError) are used but this one was not

**Files changed**:
- src/lib/plugins.ts (removed unused export)

**Reasoning**: Function exported but never used. Part of incomplete plugin hook pattern - likely written proactively but never integrated.

**Impact**: Reduced API surface area by 1 function. Cleaner plugin interface.

**All checks passed**: format, lint, types ✓

## Iteration 3

**Task**: Remove unused _getStatusLabel() function (PRD cleanup task)

**What was done**:
- Removed _getStatusLabel() function from src/components/DiffPreview.tsx (22 lines)
- Function was defined but never called anywhere
- Marked as "@internal Reserved for future verbose mode" but never implemented
- Component only uses getStatusColor() for its display logic

**Files changed**:
- src/components/DiffPreview.tsx (removed unused function)

**Reasoning**: Dead code reserved for future feature that was never implemented. Function provides string labels for status codes but is never called.

**Impact**: Reduced dead code by 22 lines. Cleaner component, no feature loss.

**All checks passed**: format, lint, types ✓

## Iteration 4

**Task**: Remove unused keychain functions (PRD cleanup task)

**What was done**:
- Removed deleteApiKeyFromKeychain() from src/lib/keychain.ts (14 lines)
- Removed hasApiKeyInKeychain() from src/lib/keychain.ts (4 lines)
- Removed loadApiKeyFromKeychain() from src/lib/keychain.ts (14 lines)
- Only getApiKeyFromKeychain() and saveApiKeyToKeychain() are used (imported in claude.ts)

**Files changed**:
- src/lib/keychain.ts (removed 3 unused exports, 54 lines total)

**Reasoning**: Functions exported but never imported. Only 2 of 5 keychain functions are used. Dead code removal.

**Impact**: Reduced API surface area by 3 functions, removed 54 lines. Cleaner keychain module.

**All checks passed**: format, lint, types ✓

## Iteration 5

**Task**: Remove unused type exports from use-keyboard.ts (PRD cleanup task)

**What was done**:
- Removed export keyword from KeyHandler type (used only internally)
- Removed export keyword from KeyHandlers interface (used only internally)
- Removed export keyword from UseKeyboardShortcutsOptions interface (used only internally)
- Removed export keyword from KeyboardState interface (used only internally)
- Removed export keyword from KeyboardActions interface (used only internally)
- Only useKeyboardShortcuts function remains exported (the actual hook)

**Files changed**:
- src/hooks/use-keyboard.ts (made 5 type definitions private)

**Reasoning**: All 5 types exported but never imported anywhere. Types only used within hook file itself. Exporting them unnecessarily increases API surface area and suggests they're part of public API when they're implementation details.

**Impact**: Cleaner module interface, reduced unnecessary type exports. Hook still functions identically but with clearer boundaries.

**All checks passed**: format, lint, types ✓

## Iteration 6

**Task**: Remove unused NotifyOptions export (PRD cleanup task)

**What was done**:
- Removed export keyword from NotifyOptions interface in src/lib/notify.ts
- Interface only used as parameter type within notify.ts, never imported elsewhere

**Files changed**:
- src/lib/notify.ts (made NotifyOptions private)

**Reasoning**: Interface exported but never imported. Only used internally as type for notify() function's options parameter. Exporting unnecessarily increases API surface area.

**Impact**: Cleaner module interface, reduced unnecessary type export. Function signature unchanged.

**All checks passed**: format, lint, types ✓

## Iteration 7

**Task**: Remove unused getDefaultConfig() export (PRD cleanup task)

**What was done**:
- Deleted getDefaultConfig() function from src/lib/config.ts (5 lines)
- Function exported but never imported anywhere
- DEFAULT_CONFIG already used internally by loadConfig()

**Files changed**:
- src/lib/config.ts (removed unused export)

**Reasoning**: Function exported but never used. Appears to be written proactively for potential future use but never integrated. DEFAULT_CONFIG constant already provides defaults within loadConfig().

**Impact**: Reduced API surface area by 1 function, removed 5 lines. Cleaner config module.

**All checks passed**: format, lint, types ✓
