# Progress Log

## Iteration 1

**Task**: Remove unused openInEditor() function (PRD cleanup task)

**What was done**:
- Deleted entire src/lib/editor.ts file (38 lines of dead code)
- openInEditor() function was exported but never imported anywhere
- Function provided editor-opening functionality that was never integrated

**Files changed**:
- src/lib/editor.ts (deleted entirely)

**Reasoning**: Complete dead code file. Function exported but never used. Removing eliminates unnecessary execa dependency usage and 38 lines of maintenance burden.

**Impact**: Reduced codebase by 38 lines. Eliminated unused editor integration module. Cleaner lib/ directory.

**All checks passed**: format, lint, types ✓

## Iteration 2

**Task**: Remove unused runBeforeIteration() function (PRD cleanup task)

**What was done**:
- Removed runBeforeIteration() function from src/lib/plugins.ts (9 lines)
- Function was exported but never imported anywhere
- Other plugin hook wrappers (runBeforeRun, runAfterIteration, runDone, runOnError) are used but this one was not

**Files changed**:
- src/lib/plugins.ts (removed unused export)

**Reasoning**: Function exported but never used. Part of incomplete plugin hook pattern - likely written proactively but never integrated.

**Impact**: Reduced API surface area by 1 function. Cleaner plugin interface.

**All checks passed**: format, lint, types ✓

## Iteration 3

**Task**: Remove unused _getStatusLabel() function (PRD cleanup task)

**What was done**:
- Removed _getStatusLabel() function from src/components/DiffPreview.tsx (22 lines)
- Function was defined but never called anywhere
- Marked as "@internal Reserved for future verbose mode" but never implemented
- Component only uses getStatusColor() for its display logic

**Files changed**:
- src/components/DiffPreview.tsx (removed unused function)

**Reasoning**: Dead code reserved for future feature that was never implemented. Function provides string labels for status codes but is never called.

**Impact**: Reduced dead code by 22 lines. Cleaner component, no feature loss.

**All checks passed**: format, lint, types ✓
