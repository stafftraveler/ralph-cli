## Iteration 1

**Task**: Remove duplicate formatCost() function (PRD cleanup task)

**What was done**:
- Extracted formatCost() to lib/utils.ts (exported function)
- Removed local formatCost() from components/Summary.tsx
- Removed local formatCost() from components/IterationRunner.tsx
- Removed local formatCost() from commands/run-ci.ts
- Updated all three files to import formatCost from utils

**Files changed**:
- src/lib/utils.ts (added formatCost export)
- src/components/Summary.tsx (removed local formatCost, added import)
- src/components/IterationRunner.tsx (removed local formatCost, added import)
- src/commands/run-ci.ts (removed both formatDuration and formatCost, imported from utils)

**Impact**: Eliminated code duplication, improved maintainability. Three identical implementations reduced to one shared utility.

**All checks passed**: format, lint, types ✓
