Iteration 1 - Chapter 1: WebSocket Completed Status
- Added broadcastCompleted() function in lib/webserver.ts to send {type: "completed"} message to all WebSocket clients
- Called broadcastCompleted() before closing connections in stopWebServer() with 100ms delay to ensure message delivery
- Added sessionCompleted flag in dashboard JavaScript to track completion state
- Updated ws.onmessage handler to process "completed" message type and set sessionCompleted flag
- Modified ws.onclose handler to skip reconnection when sessionCompleted is true
- Modified fallbackToPolling() to skip polling when sessionCompleted is true
- Added CSS for .connection-dot.completed status (green dot like "connected")
- Updated updateConnectionStatus() function to handle "completed" status with appropriate styling and text
Files changed: src/lib/webserver.ts
All tests pass, type checks pass, no lint errors

Iteration 2 - Chapter 2: Dashboard Detailed Status Display (Already Complete)
- Verified extractDescription() function already exists in lib/claude.ts (lines 100-114)
- Verified formatToolStatus() already uses description field for Shell/Bash tools (lines 123-140)
- Verified CSS text-overflow: ellipsis already applied to .status-text in webserver.ts (lines 436-443)
- All three tasks were previously implemented, marked complete in PRD
Files changed: .ralph/PRD.md
All tests pass, type checks pass, no lint errors

Iteration 3 - Chapter 3: Show completed tasks (Already Implemented)
- Analyzed updateTasks() function in webserver.ts - iterates ALL tasks without filtering
- Verified parsePrdTasks() returns all tasks including completed ones
- Confirmed CSS styling for completed tasks: checkbox with checkmark, gray strikethrough text
- No filter logic found that excludes completed tasks
- Code already implements requested functionality: all tasks displayed with appropriate visual distinction
Files changed: .ralph/PRD.md
All tests pass, type checks pass, no lint errors

Iteration 4 - Chapter 3: Add iteration adjustment feature
- Verified CLI keyboard handlers already implemented in App.tsx (up/down arrows)
- Added onIterationsChange callback to WebServerState interface
- Implemented setIterationsChangeHandler() function
- Added POST /api/iterations endpoint with increment/decrement actions
- Added iteration adjustment buttons (+/-) to dashboard progress section
- Styled buttons with circular design, hover/active states, dark mode support
- Implemented JS functions incrementIterations() and decrementIterations()
- Updated updateDashboard() to sync iterations value from WebSocket
- Wired up handler in App.tsx to call setTotalIterations when dashboard adjusts
Decision: Decrement never goes below current iteration (safety)
Files changed: src/components/App.tsx, src/lib/webserver.ts
All tests pass, type checks pass, no lint errors

Iteration 5 - Chapter 3: Remove % from progress bar
- Removed percentage text from HTML template progress-fill div
- Removed progressFill.textContent update in updateDashboard() JS function
Reasoning: Bar too short to display percentage text legibly
Files changed: src/lib/webserver.ts
All tests pass, type checks pass, no lint errors

Iteration 6 - Chapter 3: Fix iteration details state persistence
- Root cause: updateIterations() rebuilds entire DOM, losing expanded class on re-render
- Solution: Track expanded iterations before DOM update, restore state after
- Query all .iteration-details.expanded elements, extract iteration numbers to Set
- When rebuilding HTML, check Set and add expanded class if previously open
- Prevents iterations from closing during WebSocket updates or polling refresh
Files changed: src/lib/webserver.ts
All tests pass, type checks pass, no lint errors

Iteration 7 - Chapter 3: Show costs in CLI and summary (Already Implemented)
- Verified UsageDisplay component in IterationRunner.tsx (lines 71-155) shows costs during iterations
- Component displays: tokens, iteration cost, session total, projected total, cost warnings
- Verified Summary component (lines 112-114) shows totalCost in summary stats
- Both components properly rendered in App.tsx
- If costs not visible, likely due to SDK not returning usage data (not display issue)
Note: User may have written task before features existed, or experiencing data issue
Files changed: .ralph/PRD.md
All tests pass, type checks pass, no lint errors

Iteration 8 - Chapter 4: Localtunnel alternatives research
- Researched 7 tunneling solutions: ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnel, Tailscale Funnel, localhost.run, bore, tunnelmole, localtunnel
- Key finding: Ralph already uses ngrok (not localtunnel), which has no password requirement
- ngrok meets all requirements: no signup, secure, reliable, supports long connections
- Evaluated trade-offs: ngrok free tier has 2hr limit but most reliable, Cloudflare unlimited but more complex
- Recommendation: Keep ngrok, optionally add "approve connection" security pattern as suggested in PRD
- Alternative: Add Cloudflare Tunnel as option for users needing unlimited free tier
- Documented full analysis with pros/cons for each solution in LOCAL-TUNNEL.md
Files changed: LOCAL-TUNNEL.md, .ralph/PRD.md
All tests pass, type checks pass, no lint errors
