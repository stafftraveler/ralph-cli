## Iteration 1 - Token usage and cost tracking fix

Task: Fix token usage and cost reporting based on SDK documentation
Reference: PRD task 1

Changes:
- Fixed session cost accumulation in session.ts addIterationResult()
- Added sessionCostSoFar prop to IterationRunner in App.tsx
- Session now tracks totalCostUsd cumulatively across iterations
- Live cost display now shows session total during execution

Files changed:
- src/lib/session.ts: Added cumulative cost calculation
- src/components/App.tsx: Pass sessionCostSoFar to IterationRunner

Result: Token usage and costs now properly reported with live session totals in UI

Note: Reviewed SDK docs. Current implementation correctly captures usage from result message and displays it. The issue was missing cumulative session cost tracking, now fixed.

## Iteration 2 - Config error handling fix

Task: Review codebase and fix issues
Reference: PRD task 2

Issue found: config.ts error handling was inconsistent with plugins.ts and comment
- config.ts would throw on read errors (EACCES, etc), crashing the app
- Comment claimed it would "use defaults" but code would throw
- Inconsistent with plugins.ts which logs errors and continues

Changes:
- Fixed error handling in loadConfig() to log warnings instead of throwing
- Now gracefully falls back to defaults if config file can't be read
- Consistent with plugin loading behavior

Files changed:
- src/lib/config.ts: Changed error handling to warn + use defaults

Result: App now handles config read errors gracefully, improving robustness

## Iteration 3 - Package release preparation

Task: Prepare package for release to @stafftraveler/ralph-cli
Reference: PRD task 3

Decision: Automatic init on postinstall would be intrusive
- Running 'ralph init' automatically could modify user package.json unexpectedly
- May fail if not in git repo, causing installation failures
- Better UX: show helpful instructions instead

Changes:
- Created bin/postinstall.js: Shows setup instructions after install
- Updated package.json: Added postinstall script, included README/LICENSE in files
- Enhanced README.md: Clearer installation flow, detailed publishing instructions
- Added comprehensive publishing guide with prerequisites and steps

Files changed:
- bin/postinstall.js: New postinstall message script
- package.json: Added postinstall script, updated files array
- README.md: Improved installation section, added detailed publishing guide

Result: Package ready for release with user-friendly installation experience
