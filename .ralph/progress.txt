## Iteration 1: Code smell scan & duplicate code fix

**Task**: Scanned webserver.ts for code smells; fixed duplicate polling check

**Decisions**:
- Identified 7 major code smells in webserver.ts
- Prioritized fixing duplicate code (lines 1841-1845) as first issue
- Removed redundant "Skip refresh if user is typing" check in refreshData()

**Files changed**:
- .ralph/PRD.md (documented 7 code smells)
- src/lib/webserver.ts (removed duplicate if check)

**Notes**: Large monolithic file needs refactoring - HTML/CSS/JS should be extracted to separate files with build step. This is the main architectural issue to address next.

## Iteration 2: Replace magic numbers with named constants

**Task**: Replace hardcoded WebSocket ready state value `1` with `WebSocket.OPEN`

**Decisions**:
- Changed import from `type { WebSocket }` to `{ WebSocket }` to access static constants
- Replaced all 4 occurrences of `client.readyState === 1` with `client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN`
- Removed redundant comments that just repeated the constant name

**Files changed**:
- src/lib/webserver.ts (imports and 4 readyState checks)

**Notes**: Using named constants improves code readability and prevents magic number errors.

## Iteration 3: Fix broken regex pattern

**Task**: Fix regex pattern in updateIterations function (line 1989)

**Decisions**:
- Changed `/iteration-details-(d+)/` to `/iteration-details-(\d+)/`
- Pattern was matching literal "d+" instead of digits
- Fix enables proper capture of iteration numbers from DOM element IDs

**Files changed**:
- src/lib/webserver.ts (line 1989 regex pattern)

**Notes**: This bug would prevent expanded iteration details from staying expanded after updates. The backslash escape is required for digit matching.
