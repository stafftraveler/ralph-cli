## Iteration 1 - Token usage and cost tracking fix

Task: Fix token usage and cost reporting based on SDK documentation
Reference: PRD task 1

Changes:
- Fixed session cost accumulation in session.ts addIterationResult()
- Added sessionCostSoFar prop to IterationRunner in App.tsx
- Session now tracks totalCostUsd cumulatively across iterations
- Live cost display now shows session total during execution

Files changed:
- src/lib/session.ts: Added cumulative cost calculation
- src/components/App.tsx: Pass sessionCostSoFar to IterationRunner

Result: Token usage and costs now properly reported with live session totals in UI

Note: Reviewed SDK docs. Current implementation correctly captures usage from result message and displays it. The issue was missing cumulative session cost tracking, now fixed.
