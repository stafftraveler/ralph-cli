Iteration 1 - Chapter 1: WebSocket Completed Status
- Added broadcastCompleted() function in lib/webserver.ts to send {type: "completed"} message to all WebSocket clients
- Called broadcastCompleted() before closing connections in stopWebServer() with 100ms delay to ensure message delivery
- Added sessionCompleted flag in dashboard JavaScript to track completion state
- Updated ws.onmessage handler to process "completed" message type and set sessionCompleted flag
- Modified ws.onclose handler to skip reconnection when sessionCompleted is true
- Modified fallbackToPolling() to skip polling when sessionCompleted is true
- Added CSS for .connection-dot.completed status (green dot like "connected")
- Updated updateConnectionStatus() function to handle "completed" status with appropriate styling and text
Files changed: src/lib/webserver.ts
All tests pass, type checks pass, no lint errors

Iteration 2 - Chapter 2: Dashboard Detailed Status Display (Already Complete)
- Verified extractDescription() function already exists in lib/claude.ts (lines 100-114)
- Verified formatToolStatus() already uses description field for Shell/Bash tools (lines 123-140)
- Verified CSS text-overflow: ellipsis already applied to .status-text in webserver.ts (lines 436-443)
- All three tasks were previously implemented, marked complete in PRD
Files changed: .ralph/PRD.md
All tests pass, type checks pass, no lint errors

Iteration 3 - Chapter 3: Show completed tasks (Already Implemented)
- Analyzed updateTasks() function in webserver.ts - iterates ALL tasks without filtering
- Verified parsePrdTasks() returns all tasks including completed ones
- Confirmed CSS styling for completed tasks: checkbox with checkmark, gray strikethrough text
- No filter logic found that excludes completed tasks
- Code already implements requested functionality: all tasks displayed with appropriate visual distinction
Files changed: .ralph/PRD.md
All tests pass, type checks pass, no lint errors

Iteration 4 - Chapter 3: Add iteration adjustment feature
- Verified CLI keyboard handlers already implemented in App.tsx (up/down arrows)
- Added onIterationsChange callback to WebServerState interface
- Implemented setIterationsChangeHandler() function
- Added POST /api/iterations endpoint with increment/decrement actions
- Added iteration adjustment buttons (+/-) to dashboard progress section
- Styled buttons with circular design, hover/active states, dark mode support
- Implemented JS functions incrementIterations() and decrementIterations()
- Updated updateDashboard() to sync iterations value from WebSocket
- Wired up handler in App.tsx to call setTotalIterations when dashboard adjusts
Decision: Decrement never goes below current iteration (safety)
Files changed: src/components/App.tsx, src/lib/webserver.ts
All tests pass, type checks pass, no lint errors
