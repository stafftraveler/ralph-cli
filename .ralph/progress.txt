## Iteration 1 - Fix linting errors

**Task**: Fix linting errors (PRD line 21)

**Changes**:
- Fixed unused parameter in use-tunnel.ts error handler (prefixed with `_err`)
- Fixed circular dependency issue between startTunnel and scheduleReconnect by using ref pattern
- Removed unnecessary `port` dependency from useEffect (outer scope value)

**Files changed**:
- src/hooks/use-tunnel.ts

**Key decisions**:
- Used ref pattern (scheduleReconnectRef) to break circular dependency between useCallback hooks
- This maintains proper React hooks dependencies while avoiding circular references

**Status**: ✅ Complete - all linting errors fixed, tests pass

## Iteration 2 - Remove unused exports

**Task**: Scan for code smells and fix ONE issue (PRD line 22)

**Changes**:
- Removed unused standalone functions: startTunnel() and stopTunnel()
- Both exports were never imported or used anywhere in codebase
- The useTunnel() hook is the main API; standalone functions were dead code

**Files changed**:
- src/hooks/use-tunnel.ts

**Key decisions**:
- Removed both functions together as they're tightly related utilities
- Verified with ts-prune and grep that no imports exist

**Status**: ✅ Complete - dead code removed, all checks pass
