## Iteration 1

**Task**: Initial review of PRD
**Status**: PRD contains empty template with single task "You're done!"
**Action**: No work required - PRD already complete
**Files changed**: None
**Notes**: Repository is in working state, no tasks to implement


## Iteration 2

**Task**: Fix TypeScript errors in LinearIssueSelector after FetchIssuesResult interface addition
**PRD ref**: Fixing uncommitted work from previous iteration
**Decisions**: Updated LinearIssueSelector to destructure FetchIssuesResult properly
**Files changed**: 
  - src/components/LinearIssueSelector.tsx (fixed type errors)
**Notes**: fetchRecentIssues now returns {issues, hasMore, endCursor} instead of LinearIssue[]. Component already had pagination support added by previous iteration, just needed to destructure result properly.
