## Iteration 1

Task: Remove unused InitOptions type and _options parameter from init.ts

Completed:
- Scanned src/ codebase for code smells using ts-prune and manual analysis
- Documented 14 issues in PRD.md (3 high, 5 medium, 4 low, 2 style)
- Removed unused InitOptions type export (line 99)
- Removed unused _options parameter from runInit function (line 151)
- Verified call site in index.tsx only passes repoRoot

Files changed:
- src/commands/init.ts: Removed InitOptions type, simplified runInit signature
- .ralph/PRD.md: Added comprehensive list of code smell tasks

Tests: All 86 tests passing
Type check: Clean
Lint: Clean

## Iteration 2

Task: Consolidate formatDuration - remove duplicate from webserver.ts

Completed:
- Identified 3 instances of formatDuration: utils.ts (canonical), webserver.ts server-side (duplicate), webserver.ts client-side JS (needed for browser)
- Added import of formatDuration from utils.js to webserver.ts
- Removed duplicate server-side formatDuration function (lines 226-241)
- Kept client-side JavaScript version in HTML template (runs in browser, cannot import)

Files changed:
- src/lib/webserver.ts: Added import, removed duplicate function

Reasoning: utils.ts is the single source of truth for shared utilities. Client-side JS in HTML template must remain separate as it executes in browser context.

Tests: All 86 tests passing
Type check: Clean
Lint: Clean

## Iteration 3

Task: Fix error handling in use-claude.ts catch block - add debug logging

Completed:
- Changed catch block parameter from _error to error (line 169)
- Added DEBUG-guarded error logging with detailed information (name, message, stack)
- Improved status message to differentiate "Cancelled" vs "Failed" based on error type
- Detects AbortError by checking error.name and message for abort signals

Files changed:
- src/hooks/use-claude.ts: Enhanced catch block with debug logging and better status

Reasoning: Swallowed errors reduce debuggability. Debug logging follows codebase pattern (process.env.DEBUG). Distinguishing cancellation from failure improves UX.

Tests: All 86 tests passing
Type check: Clean
Lint: Clean
Format: Applied (1 file formatted)

## Iteration 4

Task: Remove unused _config parameter from runClaude in claude.ts

Completed:
- Removed _config: RalphConfig parameter from runClaude function signature (line 235)
- Updated JSDoc to remove @param config reference
- Updated all call sites: run-ci.ts, use-claude.ts, claude.test.ts (9 test calls)
- Removed unused RalphConfig import from claude.ts
- Removed unused loadConfig import and config variable from run-ci.ts

Files changed:
- src/lib/claude.ts: Removed parameter, simplified signature, removed unused import
- src/commands/run-ci.ts: Updated call site, removed unused config loading
- src/hooks/use-claude.ts: Updated call site
- src/lib/claude.test.ts: Updated all 9 test calls

Reasoning: Config was never used inside runClaude - cost limits are checked in use-claude.ts hook instead. Removing unused parameter simplifies API.

Tests: All 86 tests passing
Type check: Clean
Lint: Clean

## Iteration 5

Task: Export NotifyOptions interface in notify.ts

Completed:
- Added export keyword to NotifyOptions interface (line 9)
- Added JSDoc comment for the interface
- Verified interface is used in App.tsx when calling notify()
- Removed unused mockConfig and RalphConfig import from claude.test.ts (leftover from previous iteration)

Files changed:
- src/lib/notify.ts: Exported NotifyOptions interface with documentation
- src/lib/claude.test.ts: Cleanup - removed unused mockConfig and import

Reasoning: Exporting the interface improves API discoverability and allows callers to type options programmatically. Interface is used inline in App.tsx - export enables better type safety if needed.

Tests: All 86 tests passing
Type check: Clean
Lint: Clean

## Iteration 6

Task: Standardize function declarations - verify consistent use of function keyword

Completed:
- Comprehensive scan of src/lib/ and src/hooks/ directories
- Verified all pure utility functions use `function` keyword (not arrow functions)
- Verified React hooks use proper function declarations
- Verified arrow functions only used for callbacks, array methods, and nested functions
- No violations found - codebase already follows CLAUDE.md guidelines consistently

Files reviewed:
- src/lib/*.ts: All 12 files use `function` keyword for pure functions
- src/hooks/*.ts: All 5 files use `function` keyword for exports
- Pattern is consistent across entire codebase

Reasoning: CLAUDE.md specifies "Use function keyword for pure functions" and "Use React hooks for stateful logic." Codebase already adheres to this standard. No changes needed.

Tests: All 86 tests passing (no code changes)
Type check: Clean
Lint: Clean

## Iteration 7

Task: Review and add debug logging to empty catch blocks in cli.ts

Completed:
- Added DEBUG-guarded error logging to 3 catch blocks in cli.ts
- Line 22 (getVersion): Logs error when package.json read fails, returns default version
- Line 95 (showDryRunInfo): Logs error when PRD.md read fails for task count
- Line 110 (showDryRunInfo): Logs error when prompt.md read fails for preview

Files changed:
- src/cli.ts: Enhanced 3 catch blocks with debug logging

Reasoning: Empty catch blocks hide errors during development. Debug logging (guarded by process.env.DEBUG) helps diagnose issues without cluttering normal output. All three cases have user-facing fallback messages already.

Tests: All 86 tests passing
Type check: Clean
Lint: Clean

## Iteration 8

Task: Review and add debug logging to empty catch blocks in use-git.ts

Completed:
- Added DEBUG-guarded error logging to 8 catch blocks in use-git.ts
- Line 11 (getRepoRoot): Logs error when git repo root detection fails
- Line 23 (isGitRepo): Logs error when git repository check fails
- Line 35 (getCurrentBranch): Logs error when branch name detection fails
- Line 47 (getCurrentCommit): Logs error when commit SHA fetch fails
- Line 60 (createBranch): Logs error when branch creation fails (first attempt)
- Line 65 (createBranch): Logs error when switching to existing branch fails (second attempt)
- Line 95 (getCommitsSince): Logs error when git log command fails
- Line 146 (getDiffStats): Logs error when diff stats command fails

Files changed:
- src/hooks/use-git.ts: Enhanced 8 catch blocks with debug logging

Reasoning: Git operations can fail for various reasons (not in repo, invalid SHA, permissions). Debug logging helps diagnose issues without affecting normal operation. All functions have sensible fallback returns (null, false, or empty arrays).

Tests: All 86 tests passing
Type check: Clean
Lint: Clean
