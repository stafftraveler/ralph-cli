## Iteration 1: Set up Vitest testing framework

Task: PRD Task 1.1 - Set up Vitest testing framework

Decisions:
- Used Vitest v2.1.9 with v8 coverage provider
- Configured for Node environment with globals enabled
- Set include pattern: src/**/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx}
- Added @vitest/coverage-v8 for coverage reporting
- Excluded standard files from coverage (tests, bin, d.ts files)

Files changed:
- package.json: Added vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 devDeps, added test scripts (test, test:watch, test:coverage)
- vitest.config.ts: Created config with Node env, coverage settings, and path alias

Notes:
- Test framework is ready, no test files exist yet (expected)
- Next tasks will add actual test files for session, config, claude, and git modules
